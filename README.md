## Social Distance Using TensorFlow Object Detection API
Today, unfortunately, everyone is familiar with the term "social distance". It's something we will have to live with for a while until everything returns to normal. At [Immune Technology Institute](https://immune.institute/en/) we have developed an application using the TensorFlow Object Detection API for identifying and measuring the social distance between pedestrians.

We will detect pedestrians and calculate the distance between them. We have used the `SSD with Mobilenet` model and we created some functions to improve the visualization of our predictions.
